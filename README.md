## About

CRISPR is the technical and innovation club of IIIT Nagpur.

Our main focus is building practical projects that can actually be used.  
We encourage students to experiment, innovate, and work on real systems instead of only theoretical work.

The goal is simple: build things that work and learn by creating.

---

## What we do

- Build real-world software and technical projects  
- Work on innovative ideas and experimental builds  
- Collaborate on hackathons and open-source  
- Support technical initiatives inside the institute  
- Maintain useful internal tools and platforms  

Most work happens directly through project repositories and active collaboration.
