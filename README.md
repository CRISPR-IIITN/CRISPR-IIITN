## Overview

Central Research Initiative & Student Public Relations (CRISPR) is a student-led technical and research organization at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Nagpur. The organization focuses on building and maintaining technical platforms, supporting research-driven initiatives, and managing student-facing digital infrastructure.

---

## About

CRISPR functions as a central technical body that designs, develops, and maintains software systems and digital resources used within the institute. Alongside technical development, the organization also handles student publications, internal tooling, and technical coordination for events and institutional initiatives.

The objective of CRISPR is to create reliable, well-documented, and maintainable systems while promoting a culture of technical rigor, collaboration, and responsibility among students.

## Projects

The organization maintains multiple repositories that represent its active and past work. These include, but are not limited to:

- Internal and public-facing web platforms
- Centralized servers and shared services
- Student portals and management systems
- Event-related technical systems

Each repository contains its own documentation describing scope, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines.

### Repository Presentation Standards

To maintain clarity and consistency, CRISPR follows a repository-first visual approach:

- Visual elements such as screenshots, demo GIFs, and architecture diagrams are included **inside individual project repositories**, not on the organization root.
- Each active project repository is expected to include:
  - A concise project description
  - Setup and usage instructions
  - At least one visual reference (screenshot or demo) where applicable

This ensures that visual context is provided where it is most relevant, without cluttering the organization overview.
