## About

CRISPR is the central student-led technical and research body of the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Nagpur.

The organization designs, builds, and maintains institutional software systems, shared infrastructure, and research-driven technical initiatives used across the institute.

CRISPR operates with a long-term systems approach — prioritizing reliability, maintainability, and institutional continuity over short-term development.

---

## Scope of Work

CRISPR functions as an institutional engineering and research unit responsible for:

- Institutional platforms and student-facing systems  
- Shared servers and infrastructure  
- Research and experimental engineering projects  
- Internal automation and tooling  
- Technical support for institute initiatives and events  
- Student publications and digital resources  

All systems are developed with an emphasis on documentation, stability, and maintainability.

---

## Repositories

This organization contains repositories representing active systems, infrastructure, and experimental work.

Repository categories include:

- Institutional web platforms and portals  
- Infrastructure and deployment systems  
- Automation and internal tools  
- Research and experimental projects  

Each repository maintains independent documentation covering architecture, setup, and contribution requirements.

### Repository Standards

CRISPR follows a repository-first structure:

- Visuals, demos, and architecture diagrams remain within individual repositories  
- Each active repository must include:
  - Clear technical documentation  
  - Setup and usage instructions  
  - Relevant visual or architectural references
